Project Meadowlark is a research and development effort to explore potential for
use of new technologies, including managed cloud services, for starting up a
"cloud native" Ed-Fi compatible API.

While it was originally intended as a proof-of-concept, as of January, 2023 it
is _moving toward_ production readiness. We plan to have release milestone 0.3.0
in the first quarter of 2023, and already have a first pilot project lined up.

See [Project Meadowlark - Exploring Next Generation
Technologies](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/x/RwJqBw) in Tech Docs for more
information on the background and design decisions for this project.

### 😕 Cloud Deployment

You may be asking yourself, "where are the instructions for cloud deployment?"
We're working on it. Milestone 0.1.0 had severless deploy to AWS built-in, but
there were several aspects that no longer fit well with our refined strategy  in
milestone 0.2.0, so the current release does not have any intrinsic cloud
deployment support. The upcoming 0.3.0 release will have basic deployment
capabilities on Azure, the preferred platform for our first pilot project.
