Project Meadowlark is a research and development effort to explore potential for
use of new technologies, including managed cloud services, for starting up a
"cloud native" Ed-Fi compatible API.

While it was originally intended as a proof-of-concept, it is now _moving
toward_ production readiness. [Milestone
0.3.0](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Exchange-OSS/Meadowlark/releases/tag/v0.3.0) has
been released with Docker and real OAuth2 support. Next steps will be to take
feedback from pilot tests, flesh out the PostgreSQL support, tune performance,
and work toward full streaming support.

See [Project Meadowlark - Exploring Next Generation
Technologies](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/x/RwJqBw) in Tech Docs for more
information on the background and design decisions for this project.
