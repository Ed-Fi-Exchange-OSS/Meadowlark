The Meadowlark code and releases provide a deployable, distributable,
proof-of-concept for a cloud-native (i.e., built on cloud services)
implementation of the Ed-Fi API surface. It therefore replicates the data
collection capabilities of the Ed-Fi ODS/API, but does not replicate the
database structure and storage of the ODS/API.

:no_entry: Warning :no_entry:: this is not for use in production or
production-like settings.
