Project Meadowlark is a research and development effort to explore potential for
use of new technologies, including managed cloud services, for starting up a
"cloud native" Ed-Fi compatible API.

While it was originally intended as a proof-of-concept, it is now _moving
toward_ production readiness. [Milestone
0.3.0](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Exchange-OSS/Meadowlark/releases/tag/v0.3.0) has
been released with Docker and real OAuth2 support. Next steps will be to take
feedback from pilot tests, flesh out the PostgreSQL support, tune performance,
and work toward full streaming support.

See [Project Meadowlark - Exploring Next Generation
Technologies](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/x/RwJqBw) in Tech Docs for more
information on the background and design decisions for this project.

### ðŸ˜• Cloud Deployment

You may be asking yourself, "where are the instructions for cloud deployment?"
We're working on it. Milestone 0.1.0 had severless deploy to AWS built-in, but
there were several aspects that no longer fit well with our refined strategy  in
milestone 0.2.0, so the current release does not have any intrinsic cloud
deployment support. The upcoming 0.3.0 release will have basic deployment
capabilities on Azure, the preferred platform for our first pilot project.
