Project Meadowlark is a research and development effort to explore potential for
use of new technologies, including managed cloud services, for starting up an
Ed-Fi compatible API.

While it was originally intended as a proof-of-concept, due to positive feedback
from the community, it is _beginning to align_ towards production readiness.
However, the current milestone 0.2.0 release leaves much work yet to be done
before there is a complete tool that could be used in a pilot test. Pilot
readiness is the current goal for milestone 0.3.0, which we hope to make
available before the Ed-Fi Summit in early November, 2022.

See [Project Meadowlark - Exploring Next Generation
Technologies](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/x/RwJqBw) in Tech Docs for more
information on the background and design decisions for this project.
