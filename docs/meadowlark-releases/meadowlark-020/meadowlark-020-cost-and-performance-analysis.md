# Meadowlark 0.2.0 - Cost and Performance Analysis

> [!WARNING]
> Broad goals, with details to be filled in as the development team gets closer to being able to tackle this problem:
> *   Upload to AWS
> *   Consider any or all of the following tools:
>     *   Smoke test utility
>     *   Bulk upload grand bend
>     *   API-to-API synchronization tool to copy data from an ODS/API 5.3 installation to Meadowlark
> *   Must be able to time the process
> *   Start with a small data set (Grand Bend) and look at the cost before moving forward
>     *   If cost is sufficiently low, run 5 times to get real statistics
> *   Increase the data set size, using output from Sample Data Generator to tune the data set to the desired "size"
> *   Go carefully so as not to rack up a huge bill!
