# Meadowlark

For see [Project Meadowlark - Exploring Next Generation
Technologies](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/x/RwJqBw) in Tech Docs more information
on the Meadowlark architecture.

## Document Identifiers

Each document posted to the Meadowlark API is assigned a unique Document
Identifier formed by calculating a SHA-3 SHAKE-256 hash value from two
components, and then concatenating the result. These identifiers are
deterministic and repeatable across nodes in a cluster or disparate
installations. This unique identifier then becomes the "primary key" for data
store lookups of a single object, and it is used in the query string for HTTP
requests to a particular document.

The first component in the identifier the data model name and resource type,
separated by `#`. Example: `Ed-Fi#Student`. The second component is a key-value
pair representing the natural key components as defined by the Ed-Fi Data
Standard. Example: `{"studentUniqueId":"abc"}`. These are then combined as:

```none
hash(Ed-Fi#Student) + hash({"studentUniqueId":"abc"})
```

The hash values are further base 64 encoded for string storage, leading to a
38-character string. For example: `WhT14ozRv-M80122NydSim1PK4FiQIxmPRXMTA`
corresponds to the student document described above.

## Authentication

Due to time constraints, the implementation contains a simple test harness with
support for a few hard-coded key/secret combinations. These key/secret pairs
will support OAuth2 client credentials flow and create signed JSON Web Tokens
(JWT) that encode claim information. The claim information can then be used for
authorization and record ownership. Please note that the protection is
incomplete; for example, it does not verify the `aud` . It does verify the
signing key.

* Default token endpoint: `/{stage}/api/oauth/token`
* Verification endpoint (useful for debugging): `GET /{stage}/verify` with
  authorization header
* Create a random key for signing: `GET /stage/createKey`
  * Place in the Meadowlark `.env`  file as SIGNING_KEY .
* Name of the vendor is stored in the subject.
* There are two hard-code key/secret pairs for different "vendors":
  | Key               | Secret              |
  | ----------------- | ------------------- |
  | â€‹meadowlark_key_1 | meadowlark_secret_1 |
  | meadowlark_key_2  | meadowlark_secret_2 |

## MetaEd to ODS/API Surface

While Ed-Fi models are described using the MetaEd language, their most common
expression is as the API surface of an ODS/API implementation.  The mapping
between MetaEd models and their API surface expression is largely
straightforward, but there are some important differences.

### Element Naming

#### Casing

Names on the ODS/API surface are always lower camel cased, whereas names in
MetaEd models are always upper camel cased.

#### Simple Names

For the most part, the names of individual elements are the same between the
MetaEd model and ODS/API surface. MetaEd "role names" are expressed as prefixes
on the property name.

#### Name Overlap Collasping

The ODS/API surface has naming rules that remove overlapping prefixes of
properties that match the parent entity name in some cases. As a simple example,
a MetaEd property "XyzAbcd" on an entity "Xyz" may be expressed in the API as
"Abcd". However, the rules for name collapsing can get quite involved in complex
cases, and is beyond the scope of this document.

### References

In general, a reference on the ODS/API surface is made up of the set of
individual natural key values that specify the referenced entity. This set is
wrapped by an object named "xyzReference", where "xyz" is the singularized name
of the entity being referred to.

#### Reference Collections

Reference collections are arrays of single item references where the array is
named as the pluralized name of the entity being referred to.

#### Descriptors

References to descriptors are suffixed by "Descriptor" instead of "Reference"
like all other entity references.

### Choice and Inline Common

There are no direct equivalents to MetaEd Choice and Inline Common entities in
the ODS/API. Instead, they are considered more like bags of properties which are
pulled up to the same level as the entity with the Choice/Inline Common
reference. Since references to Choice/Inline Common can be nested, the pull-up
can happen from multiple levels.
