# RND-644 - Investigate alternatives to MongoDB backend read-for-write-locking

## Goal

Measure if there are significant differences in changing the approach of emulating the write lock for MongoDB.

## Virtual Machine setup

It's essentially a **t2.2xlarge** on AWS:
  Platform: windows Server 2022.
  Number of vCPUs: 8.
  Storage: SSD with 80Gb.
  Memory: 32 Gb.

Before running performance tests based on the new approach: Materialize the conflict; we need to run tests based on the base code.
In other words, to come to a more solid conclusion we need to run performance tests based on the 2 approaches:

1. Write Lock Referenced Documents approach.
2. Materialized conflict approach.

### Write Lock Referenced Documents approach

#### Bulk Load tool

AVG time: 03:53:807

#### AutoCannon

Ran the tests/profiling/AutocannonSchools.ts script for 160 seconds, with 1 connection and then with 25 connections.

|                  | 2xxx     | Non-2xxx   | AVG Latency | AVG Request | AVG Throughput |
|------------------|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1  Connection    | 11342    | 0          | 13.6        | 70.892      | 24739.982      |
| 25 Connections   | 2745.6   | 0          | 1327.276    | 17.162      | 5990.28        |

### Materialized conflict approach

#### Bulk Load tool

AVG time: 03:28:191

#### AutoCannon

Ran the tests/profiling/AutocannonSchools.ts script for 160 seconds, with 1 connection and then with 25 connections.

|                  | 2xxx     | Non-2xxx   | AVG Latency | AVG Request | AVG Throughput |
|------------------|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1  Connection    | 10477    | 0          | 14.536      | 65.336      | 22591.816      |
| 25 Connections   | 895.6    | 0          | 2319.514    | 5.414       | 1888.624       |

## Conclusion

Based on the results, there are no significant differences on changing the current approach.
