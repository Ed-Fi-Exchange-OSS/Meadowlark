# RND-644 - Investigate alternatives to MongoDB backend read-for-write-locking

## Virtual Machine setup

It's escentially a **t2.2xlarge** on AWS:
  Platform: windows Server 2022.
  Number of vCPUs: 8.
  Storage: SSD with 80Gb.
  Memory: 32 Gb.

## Base code

Before running performance tests based on the new approach: Materialize the conflict; we need to run tests based on the base code.
In other words, to come to a more solid conclusion we need to run performance tests based on the 2 approaches:

1. Write Lock Referenced Documents approach.
2. Materialized conflict approach.

### Write Lock Referenced Documents approach

#### Bulk Load tool

AVG time: 03:53:807

#### AutoCannon

Ran the tests/profiling/AutocannonSchools.ts script for 160 seconds, with 1 connection and then with 25 connections.

### Materialized conflict approach
