# Using Docker with Meadowlark

The Meadowlark project uses [Docker Containers](https://www.docker.com)
extensively for development, testing, and eventually for production
environments. This repository contains a number of different docker-compose
files and readmes; this document is a first point of entry for all of the other
work.

## Local Development

As a developer working on Meadowlark, one needs to have running instances of
several backend servicesâ€ ; the easiest way to run those services is through
Docker (â€  including: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, Debezium Connect, Kafka,
and dashboards for OpenSearch and Kafka).

For more details on how to run these services for active development work, see
[DOCKER-LOCAL-DEV](DOCKER-LOCAL-DEV.md).

## Integration and End-to-End Testing

Each backend has a small set of integration tests, that run the repository
modules against a live instance of the backend data store. For MongoDB we are
able to use an in-memory instance. For PostgreSQL and OpenSearch, we automate
startup of containers using [TestContainers](https://testcontainers.com/). The
developer does not need to do anything at runtime to make this work, other than
follow the one-time "Global Docker Configuration" steps in
[DOCKER-LOCAL-DEV](DOCKER-LOCAL-DEV.md).

## Dockerfile for Meadowlark API

In the above scenarios, the Meadowlark API is running in Node.js directly in the
host environment. To run the Meadowlark API itself in Docker, we need a
[Dockerfile](../Meadowlark-js/Dockerfile). This Dockerfile creates a temporary
development environment, copies the Meadowlark source code into the container,
builds it, and then creates a final slimmed down image without the development
tools.

The main [package.json](../Meadowlark-js/package.json) contains a number of
handy commands for dealing with this Dockerfile:

| Command           | Explanation                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| docker:lint       | Runs the Dockerfile through a [Hadolint container](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)                                               |
| docker:install    | Used _inside the Docker container build_, not for manual use. Installs required dev tools and runs `npm ci`                            |
| docker:build      | Builds the Docker image. Must run this locally any time source code has changed and you want a new local image                         |
| docker:build:wsl1 | Same as above, but works in Windows Subystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1)                                                                |
| docker:start      | Start the built Docker image by itself; requires a `.env-docker` file with _all_ environment variables set                             |
| docker:start:wsl1 | Same as above, but works in Windows Subystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1)                                                                |
| docker:halt       | Stops and removes the started instance                                                                                                 |
| docker:halt:wsl1  | Same as above, but works in Windows Subystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1)                                                                |
| docker:debug      | Starts the build Docker image, again requiring a `.env-docker` file, and drops you into a Bash session inside of the running container |
| docker:debug:wsl1 | Same as above, but works in Windows Subystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1)                                                                |

For example, from the `Meadowlark-js` directory you can execute `npm run
docker:build` to build the image.

### Build Process

The Dockerfile copies the TypeScript code into a container and runs the
TypeScript build in that context. It does not run eslint or any tests - so
before building, be sure that all test are passing at the command line.

:exclamation: You will need to rebuild the docker image with `docker:build` any
time the source code changes. Be sure to stop and re-start any running
Meadowlark API containers in order to see the changes.

### Testing the Meadowlark Image with Docker Compose

The instructions above are useful for testing the image creation and basic
startup, but not very useful for the API itself: it is hard to get the
networking right to connect that single API container to the other containers
that you might have launched for local development.

A better approach is to startup a new set of containers in a single network
together, completely independent from the "Local Dev" containers. For that, you
can use the local [docker-compose.yml](../Meadowlark-js/docker-compose.yml)
file. This single file stitches together the Meadowlark API, OpenSearch, and
MongoDB. Note that this does not support PostgreSQL at this time, because
PostgreSQL is temporarily de-prioritized. The file also contains commented out
code for running Debezium and Kafka; the code was left commented because the
data were not flowing, and configuring the correct data flow is not important
for the current release milestone.

Again the main package.json has a few useful shortcut commands:

| Command           | Explanation                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| compose:up        | Starts all of the containers in the compose file, in detached mode; first time users see note below |
| compose:up:wsl1   | Same as above, but works in Windows Subystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1)                             |
| compose:down      | Stops all of the containers in the compose file.                                                    |
| compose:down:wsl1 | Same as above, but works in Windows Subystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1)                             |
| compose:rm        | Shutdowns and _completely removes_ the Compose environment, including all storage volumes           |
| compose:rm:wsl1   | Same as above, but works in Windows Subystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1)                             |

### One Time Initialization

ðŸ’¡ Windows users: you need to run this from Window Subsystem for Linux. Make sure that you run a Bash prompt from WSL, not
the one provided by Git. You also need to have Node.js 16 installed _inside WSL_. The development team likes using
[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage this installation of Node 16.

From a Bash prompt, run init-docker-compose.sh.

```bash
# Assuming you start in the repository's root directory
chmod +x ./eng/init-docker-compose.sh
./eng/init-docker-compose.sh
```

What does this do?

1. Creates a `.env-docker` file for you, with new random OAuth 2.0 signing key
   and random MongoDb and OpenSearch passwords.
2. Builds the Meadowlark-API image.
3. Configures the MongoDB cluster / replica set.

### External URI's

Based on the default configuration:

| Service              | URL                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API                  | http://localhost:3000/local                                                            |
| OpenSearch Dashboard | http://localhost:5602                                                                  |
| MongoDB              | mongodb://mongo:${MONGODB_PASS}@mongo1:27027,mongo2:27028,mongo3:27029/?replicaSet=rs0 |

You can get the MongoDB password from the generated `Meadowlark-js/.env-docker` file.
