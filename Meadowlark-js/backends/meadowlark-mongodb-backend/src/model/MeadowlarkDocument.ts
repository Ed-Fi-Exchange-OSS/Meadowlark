   * An array of ids this document will satisfy when reference validation performs existence checks.

   * naming differences - like schoolId versus educationOrganizationId - accounted for). Such an id is an alias.
   *
   * The idea is that a subclass document provides the existence validation of both the document as its given type
   * AND as a reference to the superclass when the identity is equivalent.
   *
   * Example: Assessment has a reference to EducationOrganization, and ClassPeriod has a reference to School.
   *          School is a subclass of EducationOrganization, with schoolId being the identity of School and
   *          educationOrganizationId being the corresponding identity of EducationOrganization.
   *
   *          As a result, a single School document with schoolId=123 will satisfy the validation of both
   *          a reference from ClassPeriod to a School with schoolId=123, as well as a reference from
   *          Assessment to EducationOrganization with educationOrganizationId=123.
